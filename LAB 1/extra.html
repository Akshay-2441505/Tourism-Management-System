                <h1>Post your property</h1>
                <p>Buying, Selling, Renting, or moving into a house can be a trial by fire, especially in India where we often take the hassles involved in the process as an integral part of the home purchase process. Our new idea for Housing.com questions that behaviour, and motivates them to switch to a hassle-free experience.</p>
